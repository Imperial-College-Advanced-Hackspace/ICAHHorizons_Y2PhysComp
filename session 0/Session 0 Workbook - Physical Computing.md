## Course Structure

Welcome to the Physical Computing theme of the 2nd Year Hackspace Horizons Course. There will be 3 sessions for this theme which will be as follows:

Session 0: Basic Raspberry Pi Introduction and SSH

Session 1: Basic Python, building the robot and sensors

Session 2: More sensors

Session 3: The Challenge...

## Assessment

This theme will have homework after each session to ensure you keep on track with all the work. The homework will be submitted online and will be marked as pass/fail. 

At the end of the theme you will also submit a Success/Failures document which has a word limit of 400 words (+/-10%). The emphasis of this document will be on understanding your problems, how you went about solving them and why your solutions may not have worked. Note the emphasis is not on everything working, but on how well you understood what was wrong or what didn't work and why it didn't work. The structure can follow something similar to:

1. Introduction
2. What was your task and how did you try to achieve it?
3. What worked?
4. What failed? And why did it fail?
