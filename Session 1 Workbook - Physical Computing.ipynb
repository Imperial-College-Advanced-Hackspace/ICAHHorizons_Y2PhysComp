    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Physical Computing Theme!\n",
    "\n",
    "This session will be a workshop with lots of practical exercises that you can work through at your own pace. This is to ensure that you all gain something from this course, independent of your current Python and general programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work through this sheet as follows. For each of the following chapters, the tasks are grouped into **ascending order of difficulty**. Please attempt all tasks within the Chapter, starting with the easiest, until we reach a **Checkpoint** at which I will ask you to move on to the next Chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also cover some basics together as a class at the beginning of each chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework for the next Session\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have exercises left before wrapping up today's session, please finish them as homework for the next session. **This is mandatory.** For assessing your homework, we expect a coded solution. However, if you really get stuck with an exercise, this is not a problem, and instead of program code, we need you to explain as well as you can where and how you got stuck. It is just as useful being able to describe what the problem is as it is to solve it.\n",

    "## Writing Python programs on Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Raspberry Pi computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Raspberry Pi is a small computer the size of a credit card that you can plug into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you would use your desktop PC or laptop. You can generate spreadsheets, do word processing, browse the internet, and play games. It also plays high-definition video.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what will make it interesting for us is its capability for use in electronics projects! The main aim of the Raspberry Pi is to teach anyone how to use programming and electronics to realise their ideas. Raspberry Pi comes with a free Linux operating system that runs from an SD card, and it is powered by a USB phone charger.\n",

    "### The tools of the trade - the Linux terminal and a code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "But how about (a) writing, and (b) executing Python programs on the Rasberry Pi?\n",
    "\n",
    "For writing programs, we suggest using **Geany**, which is one of the pre-installed code editors on your Raspberry Pi. It has the handy feature that it highlights (i.e., colour-annotates) our programs as we write them, which helps a lot with their readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "You find Geany in the Programming menue, as shown in the following picture.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is rather self-explanatory, with commands like CTRL+S (save), CTRL+O (open a file) etc. working as expected. It looks like shown below. Note that the program text has been coloured automatically.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "But how to actually run the program, so the computer can do what we ask it to do? That's where the Linux terminal comes handy. Look again at the main menu bar. The terminal is the black symbol with **>\\_** in it, at the top of the screen.\n",
